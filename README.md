# DIFS
This is the Diffusion Model Inference Service. The work takes inspiration from the automated model-less
systems like "INFaaS: Automated Model-less Inference Serving" which simplify the model specification
process for developers. Such models speed up model variant generation by relying on a repository of
already trained models whiles optimizing the navigational search through the tradeoff space. Our system
is based on the Stable Diffusion Model.
